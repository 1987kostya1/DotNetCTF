# License

This program is licensed under the AGPLv3 license. This means that if you modify it and wish to re-distribute the compiled build, you have to provide the source code for it. This applies to network distribution too (if you decided to make an online version for example)
A special exception has been granted for the decryption library, as the author prefers it to be closed source at this time. The community is welcome to contribute a replacement open-source version of the library so this exception can be removed.
